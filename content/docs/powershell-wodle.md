# Running PowerShell Commands on a Wodle in Wazuh

By executing PowerShell commands through a Wazuh Wodle and formatting the results in JSON, you can streamline log processing without the need for custom decoders. This method simplifies integrationâ€”only the corresponding rules need to be defined to handle the structured output effectively.

## PowerShell Command Format

The recommended format for PowerShell commands in a Wodle is:

```powershell
Powershell -c "@{ <header> = <command> } | ConvertTo-Json -compress"
```
 - `<command>` is the PowerShell cmdlet or one-liner script that outputs an object

 - `<header>` is any name you want to add to help when writing rules

# Wodle Configuration Example

Here's how to configure the command Wodle to execute PowerShell commands:

```xml
<wodle name="command">
  <disabled>no</disabled>
  <command>Powershell -c "@{ <header> = <command> } | ConvertTo-Json -compress"</command>
  <ignore_output>no</ignore_output>
</wodle>

```

# Rule Example

To create rules for the PowerShell command output, use the following structure:

```xml
<group name="psCommand,">
  <rule id="301000" level="3">
    <decoded_as>json</decoded_as>
    <match>^{"<header>":</match>
    <description>Windows Powershell command base rule</description>
  </rule> 
</group>

```

## Benefits

 - Structured Output: JSON format provides consistent, parseable output

 - Simplified Rule Creation: No need for complex decoders

 - Flexibility: Can adapt to various PowerShell commands

 - Readability: Clear structure makes maintenance easier

## Implementation Tips

 - Always test your PowerShell commands locally before adding them to a Wodle

 - Use descriptive headers to make rule creation more intuitive

 - Consider security implications when running PowerShell commands

 - Monitor performance impact of complex commands
