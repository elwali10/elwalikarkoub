In post-incident malware investigations, fast and reliable tools are critical for uncovering persistence mechanisms. One such tool I recently discovered is KnockKnockâ€”a free, open-source utility by Objective-See that reveals persistently installed software components on macOS


## Why It Matters

Once malware infects a system, it typically establishes persistence through:

- Launch Agents/Daemons
- Browser Extensions
- Cron Jobs
- Login Items
- Kernel Extensions

KnockKnock automates detection of these persistence mechanisms, providing visibility into what's set to automatically execute on your Mac.
